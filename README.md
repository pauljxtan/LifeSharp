# LifeSharp
A implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C# with WPF. Primarily an educational project to learn more about C#, WPF and the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern.

The MVVM framework used here is largely inspired by [The World's Simplest C# WPF MVVM Example](http://www.markwithall.com/programming/2013/03/01/worlds-simplest-csharp-wpf-mvvm-example.html) by [Mark Withall](http://www.markwithall.com).

Still in very early stages...
